"""Build multimodal MCQ prompts (audio + lettered choices) for MMAU-Pro.

Provides the original terse `build_messages` (used by tests / A-B causality) plus a
set of CoT-elicitation prompt builders `build(method, rec, ...)` shared by the
comparison (`cot_compare`) and the runner (`run_mmau`). All builders return a
`list[ChatMessage]` whose user turn carries the audio as structured content, so the
PF/EPF audio carry delivers it to the model at every reasoning step.
